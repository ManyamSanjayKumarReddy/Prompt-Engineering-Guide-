--> OpenAI can perform Text Generation and completion using the models from light weight to advanced also we can control the params like temp, top_p, max tokens 
--> Output for the text Generation can be pre determined like json and other output formats we need 

--> Image Generation with Dalle and also we have text to speech and speech to text transcriptions 

--> apart from these we also have function calling and tool 
--> using these we can determine the models when to call functions also these enables api which are being called externally and can be capable of building complex aagents 

--> we also have reasoning models like o3, o4-mini  

--> Open also have the embedding :: the vector representation for semantic and similarity search

--> we also have these customization options like 

:: fine tuning :-> train models on specific data for the domain specific tasks
:: evals :-> evaluating model performance 
:: distillation :-> create, smaller, specilized mdoels for redcued inference costs and latency
